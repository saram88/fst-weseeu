## Saras's README for WeSeeU 


### Project WeSeeU / Intro
  
WeSeeU is a service company that offers virtual services for other companies in marketing and IT services. 
WeeSeU can book customers themselves in the associated booking system provided, 
but the customer himself can also choose to create a profile so that he can book services that he wants WeeSeU to perform.
The system is fully developed to start using. There is development potential but is fully used in the current version.

### Why WeSeeU ?

WeSeeU was born after a long time of insight. Realization that there are simpler and more cost-effective ways to handle both smaller and larger projects, which are not within the entrepreneur's core business but which are necessary to carry out in order to maintain their place in the market, carry out their mission towards their customer or to develop. With our solution, the customer can easily book in for services through our user-friendly booking system.

### Core Technical Concepts/Inspiration

By joining WeSeeU, you can easily focus on what your core business offers instead. Many of our customers have no idea how much time is spent on the work that cannot be derived to a certain income, and that this overhead cost is difficult to master financially. If you look at what your own hourly wage is per month, and then evaluate the number of hours spent in overhead tasks, you can easily see what it costs you. Time you could instead spend on developing your core business. WeSeeU always offers "try for hours" so you as a customer can know with certainty that you are getting quality for the money!

#### Process to set things up

1. Created a new repository from Github CI-full-tamplate and included bootstrap .4.6.2 version to my own github profile.
2. Took the HTML code and the CSS file (a certain part of it) and based on that I then had the framework to build on my code for designing functions and layout
3. Nästa steg, vad sattes upp?
4. I start buil my sites for costumers that want to be a costumer, book and for my employeds that need a admin profile and then i realize i also need a superuser that can change everything.

### Design

The website design is set in simple, paragraph form, which is intended to make it easier for the reader to navigate. The navigation bar is clear on each page, as is the footer and the pages are labelled with a 'banner' format thus ensuring users know where they are at all times. 


#### Color Scheme
The color palette was created using the palette generator [Coolers](https://coolors.co/).

The color scheme is chosen based on what statistically you say colors are associated with. Green is associated with harmony, growth and nature. Green color can have a calming effect as well as make us more focused on specific tasks.  It together with a gray tint reflects well.

All combinations of the colors used illustrate a contrast between background and text to ensure maximum user accessibility.
